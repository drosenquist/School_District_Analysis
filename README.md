# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose
Py City school board has asked that standarized test score for each school be analzyed due to suspicion that a high school in the district, Thomas High School, reported alerted test scores for its 9th grade class. Scores for Thomas' 9th grade were replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. The previous distrct wide analysis was recreated to see if the outcomes for the 9th grade scores differed between the two analysises.
